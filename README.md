# RattleM
Modified R package "Rattle" for bachelors work

Use installation.R script to install RattleM. GTK+ must be installed and Java and R versions must be same (both 32-bit or 64-bit) and R version must be greater than 3.4.0.

If GTK+ is not installed, simply loading the package with "library(rattleM)" after package installation will open a prompt to install GTK+.
